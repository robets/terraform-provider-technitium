## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `technitium_app_record` manages Technitium APP records, including import and
  application-defined record data. (#24)
- Contributed by [@Ujstor](https://github.com/Ujstor). New resources: `technitium_cluster` (Primary initialization),
  `technitium_cluster_secondary` (Secondary join, with `terraform import`
  support and in-place adoption semantics for `node_url` /
  `primary_node_url`), `technitium_sso` (OIDC SSO incl. group mapping),
  `technitium_user`, and `technitium_api_token`.
- `technitium_zone`: zone access options `query_access` +
  `query_access_network_acl` (#89) and `dynamic_update` +
  `dynamic_update_network_acl` (RFC 2136 dynamic updates).
- `technitium_server_settings`: web service TLS settings.
- TLS acceptance-test environment (`docker-compose.test.tls.yml`).
- `technitium_zone`: `dnssec.change_acknowledgment` — per-zone, per-transition operator
  acknowledgment for destructive DNSSEC changes (`"<ALGORITHM>/<CURVE>"` for a re-sign
  target, `"unsigned"` for unsigning). (#96)
- `technitium_zone`: `nx_proof` changes on a signed zone now convert in place
  (NSEC <-> NSEC3) with no key regeneration. (#96)
- `technitium_zone`: `dnssec.algorithm` and `dnssec.curve` are now validated against their
  allowed values at plan time, and invalid algorithm/curve combinations (e.g. `EDDSA` with
  `P256`) are refused before any destructive action. (#96)

### Changed

- **Behavior change for every configuration whose `stig_compliance` block resolves
  `enforcement = "strict"`** — including blocks that set only `nss`/`categorization` and
  never `enabled`, since enforcement defaults to `strict` whenever the block exists:
  unsigning a signed zone (`dnssec.enabled = false`, or removing the block) is now blocked
  at plan time until the zone declares `change_acknowledgment = "unsigned"`. Previously the
  unsign was ungated. In all postures, unsigning now draws a plan-time going-insecure
  warning (RFC 6781 §4.2.1.2), and `silent` enforcement no longer suppresses these
  action-consequence notices (it still suppresses STIG findings and the stale-acknowledgment
  removal warning). (#96)
- In-place `dnssec.algorithm`/`curve` changes on a signed zone are now refused at plan time
  with a diagnostic naming the acknowledgment and the manual procedure, instead of being
  silently ignored and failing with "Provider produced inconsistent result after apply". With
  the matching acknowledgment the provider performs the unsign/re-sign. (#96)

### Fixed

- `technitium_record`: refresh no longer aborts when the record's parent
  zone is gone ("No such zone was found"); the record is removed from state
  and planned for recreation (#88).
- `technitium_zone`: changing `dnssec` `algorithm`/`curve`/`nx_proof` on an already-signed
  ECDSA/EDDSA zone was silently ignored by Update, producing "Provider produced inconsistent
  result after apply" on every attempt. (RSA-signed zones have a separate, pre-existing state
  round-trip defect — the read model cannot represent "no curve" — tracked as #101.) (#96)
- `technitium_zone`: a `dnssec` block on a non-Primary zone is now refused at plan time.
  Technitium signs Primary zones only (`/api/zones/dnssec/sign` answers "No such primary zone
  was found" for every other type), so the block declared an intent the provider could never
  fulfil: `enabled` defaulted to `true`, Create and Update skipped signing because the type was
  not Primary, and refresh read the zone back unsigned, failing the apply with "Provider
  produced inconsistent result after apply". A Secondary serves the signed data it receives
  from its primary, so sign the zone on the primary instead. (#100)
- `technitium_sso`: removing `authority`, `client_id`, `metadata_address`, `scopes`, or
  `group_map` from configuration now sends an explicit clear. The set API retains every
  omitted parameter, so the removal previously either failed the apply with "Provider
  produced inconsistent result after apply" or — for `group_map` — was skipped silently
  while the server kept granting the removed group mappings. Server-side `group_map`
  entries now also surface as drift during refresh when the attribute is unset. Removing
  `scopes` resets the server to its default scope list (openid, profile, email), which is
  what unset already meant for that attribute. (#94)
- `technitium_user`: removing `display_name` from configuration now resets it on the
  server instead of retaining the old value and failing the apply with "Provider produced
  inconsistent result after apply". The server substitutes the username as its
  display-name default, so the attribute is read back only while it is configured. (#94)

### Added

- `AUTHORS` file crediting contributors whose merged work was never named anywhere in the
  repository, and an Attribution section in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` stating that contributors retain copyright in the work they author
  and should put their own notice on new source files. (#115)

### Security

- The acceptance-test suite no longer carries a hardcoded API token literal. The helper that
  resolves the test credential had a baked-in 64-character fallback used whenever
  `TECHNITIUM_API_TOKEN` was unset. The value authenticated only to a disposable test
  container and does not survive a container restart, so nothing needs rotating, but a
  committed credential-shaped literal is flagged by secret scanners and reads badly in a
  provider whose purpose is compliance tooling. An unset token now surfaces the provider's own
  `Missing api_token` diagnostic naming the environment variable, instead of a confusing
  invalid-token failure against whatever server is listening. A regression test scans the
  package for credential-shaped literals so one cannot be reintroduced. No production code
  changes. (#108)
- fix(ci): Go 1.26.6 toolchain — clear the govulncheck blocker red on main ([#103])

### Documentation

- Resource and data-source `page_title` values now use the tfplugindocs default,
  `"<name> <Type> - terraform-provider-technitium"`, replacing `"... - Technitium DNS Server"`.
  The product name in that slot implies an official relationship with Technitium that does not
  exist; this is a third-party provider. The templates now use the generator's own expression
  rather than restating the literal, so the value cannot drift from the build configuration.
  (#116)
- Five new worked DNSSEC examples on `technitium_zone`, covering the configurations that
  previously existed only as prose: EdDSA (Ed448), RSA for legacy-validator interoperability,
  the non-destructive NSEC/NSEC3 conversion, algorithm/curve rotation with
  `change_acknowledgment` and the DS re-publication that must follow, and taking a zone
  insecure with the parent-DS removal ordering. The destructive paths from #96 had thorough
  documentation but nothing an operator could copy. (#116)
- `technitium_catalog_membership` gains a documentation template. It was the only resource
  without one, so its page carried the schema-derived argument list and none of the worked
  examples, catalog-inheritance warning, destroy semantics, or import instructions its siblings
  provide. (#116)

### Fixed

- The `technitium_catalog_membership` example declared a `dnssec` block on a `Catalog` zone,
  which is refused at plan time since #100. The block is removed; the `Primary` member zone in
  the same example keeps its own. (#116)

### Security

- Three Go source files carried neither a copyright notice nor an SPDX license identifier:
  `internal/client/tls_errors.go`, `internal/client/tls_errors_test.go`, and
  `internal/provider/record_resource_import_test.go`. All 95 files now carry both. MPL-2.0
  section 3.4 requires those notices to survive redistribution, and this provider is published
  for environments where license and provenance metadata is inspected rather than assumed. A
  regression test walks the repository so a file cannot be added without them. (#115)

### Test infrastructure

- Acceptance-test configurations no longer hand-roll a `provider "technitium"` block pinned to
  `http://127.0.0.1:5380`. Thirty-seven blocks across ten files now use the environment-aware
  `testAccProviderHCL()` helper, so they follow `TECHNITIUM_SERVER_URL` and `TECHNITIUM_CACERT`
  during the TLS acceptance run instead of talking plaintext on 5380 while the rest of the
  suite used HTTPS on 5443. Completes the transport fix begun in #110, which corrected only the
  Go direct client. A regression test scans the package so a hardcoded endpoint cannot be
  reintroduced. (#115)

- `make docs` and `make generate` no longer delete `docs/` and fail when run from a directory
  whose name is not `terraform-provider-technitium`, which includes every git worktree.
  `tfplugindocs` infers the provider name from the working directory and clears the output
  directory before validating it, so a failed run left the generated docs deleted. Both targets
  now pass `--provider-name` explicitly. Output is byte-identical to before. (#114)

- test: gate live-server setup behind TF_ACC so `go test ./...` passes on a clean clone ([#109])
- test: direct client follows the suite's transport instead of hardcoding HTTP ([#111])

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Forwarder (`FWD`) record support is now usable end to end. Forwarder zones are
  created empty (`initializeForwarder=false`), so each upstream forwarder is
  managed as its own `technitium_record` resource rather than being baked into
  zone creation. Previously `technitium_zone` with `type = "Forwarder"` failed
  with `Parameter 'forwarder' missing.` and there was no `forwarder` argument to
  supply. Documentation gains three worked examples — a single forwarder, a
  DNSSEC-validating DoT forwarder with a plain fallback, and conditional
  forwarding for an internal namespace — each covered by acceptance tests.
  ([#69], closes [#75])

### Changed

- `FWD` record identity now includes `dnssec_validation`. Import IDs use
  `zone::name::FWD::forwarder:protocol:priority:dnssecValidation`, which lets two
  otherwise-identical forwarders be told apart in Terraform state. The legacy
  three-field form `forwarder:protocol:priority` is still accepted on import and
  leaves `dnssec_validation` unset rather than fabricating a value. ([#69])
- **`dnssec_validation` now forces replacement.** Changing it destroys and
  recreates the record instead of updating in place. This is deliberate: the
  Technitium update API treats `dnssecValidation` as a settable value rather than
  an identifier and provides no `newDnssecValidation`, so an in-place update of
  one of two colliding forwarders rewrites it onto the other and the two collapse
  into a single record. See **Upgrade Notes**. ([#69])

### Fixed

- `FWD` import no longer writes the CAA tag into the `protocol` attribute. The
  import parser returned a single shared string slot that CAA used for its tag
  and FWD reused for its protocol; `ImportState` read it under the CAA name and
  assigned it to `protocol`. Correct only by coincidence of the two types sharing
  a slot. ([#69])
- An unrelated update to a `FWD` record no longer silently disables DNSSEC
  validation. `dnssecValidation` is omitted from a partial update request when the
  configuration does not set it, and Technitium treats a missing value as `false`
  rather than "leave unchanged" — so a TTL-only change turned validation off. The
  provider now always sends the current value. ([#69])
- `FWD` records that omit `dnssec_validation` no longer show a permanent diff.
  Refresh adopted the server's value into state, producing a `false -> null`
  change on every plan, which combined with the new replacement semantics marked
  untouched records for destruction. Refresh now updates the attribute only when
  it is already tracked. ([#69])
- Compliance requirements re-validated against the July 2026 DNS STIG releases —
  BIND 9.x V3R3 and Windows Server 2022 DNS V2R5, both published 2026-07-01.
  Neither adds or removes rules, and all 42 STIG rules this provider cites are
  unchanged, so no requirement needed revision. Version citations updated
  accordingly. ([#83])
- CI: action pin check made deterministic. ([#63])

### Security

- fix(deps): bump golang.org/x/text to v0.39.0 (GO-2026-5970) ([#80])
- fix(deps): bump google.golang.org/grpc to v1.82.1 (GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf) ([#81])

- chore(renovate): drop the release-age delay on container images ([#82])

### Upgrade Notes

**`dnssec_validation` changes now replace the record.** If your configuration
changes that attribute on an existing `FWD` record, the next plan shows a
destroy-and-create rather than an in-place update. The record is briefly absent
during apply. This is the safe behaviour — the in-place path it replaces could
silently merge two forwarders into one.

**Do not define two `FWD` records that differ only by `dnssec_validation`.** If
two share the same `value`, `protocol` and `forwarder_priority`, the Technitium
API cannot tell them apart: a delete removes whichever was created first and an
update collapses the pair, both reporting success. Give each forwarder a distinct
`forwarder_priority` (or a different `value` or `protocol`). Verified against
Technitium 15.2 and 15.4 and reported upstream as
[TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer#2069](https://github.com/TechnitiumSoftware/DnsServer/issues/2069).
The provider contains what it can — replacement semantics avoid the merging
update path — but it cannot address one of an existing colliding pair.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- New `technitium_catalog_membership` resource manages catalog zone membership
  (RFC 9432) declaratively for Primary, Secondary, Stub, and Forwarder zones.
  Plan-time validation against the live Technitium API verifies that both the
  member zone and the catalog zone exist and that the catalog zone is of type
  Catalog or SecondaryCatalog. Destroying the resource unsets membership
  without deleting the underlying zone. ([#23])
- New `Client.ZoneSetCatalog(ctx, zone, catalog)` API client helper. Passing
  an empty catalog string unsets membership.

### Fixed

- STIG validators DNS-REQ-004 (zone-transfer ACL) and DNS-REQ-016 (notify
  addresses) now correctly enforce against `technitium_zone` resources.
  Both validators were silently no-op in v1.0.x and v1.1.x due to a schema
  alignment defect; strict-mode users running existing HCL without
  `allow_transfer` or `notify` populated will now see findings on
  `terraform plan`. See **Upgrade Notes** below for remediation paths.
  ([#39])

### Security

- Acceptance-test token provisioning no longer exposes the Technitium admin
  password or per-run API session token via `/proc/PID/cmdline` (`ps -ef`) or
  `/proc/PID/environ` (`ps eww`). The `testacc-token`, `testacc-token-tls`,
  and `testacc-up-tls` readiness-probe recipes were rewritten to pipe the
  password to a new `scripts/test-token-bootstrap.sh` helper on stdin. The
  helper reads the credential from stdin into a local shell variable,
  URL-encodes it via a python helper that also reads from stdin, and sends
  the form body to curl via `--data @-` on a bash heredoc. The password
  value therefore never enters argv or env of any process in the test
  harness flow. No production code or wire shape changes. ([#35])
- New CI gate (`Verify action SHA pins`) enforces full 40-character commit
  SHA pinning on every GitHub Actions `uses:` reference via
  `suzuki-shunsuke/pinact-action`. The enforcement action itself is also
  SHA-pinned so the gate does not introduce a new mutable workflow
  dependency. Policy documented in [.github/SECURITY.md](.github/SECURITY.md).
  Renovate manages SHA bumps for the `github-actions` ecosystem with a
  three-day soak window. ([#56])
- Bumped `golang.org/x/net`, `golang.org/x/crypto`, and the Go toolchain
  to clear GO-2026-5026 and GO-2026-5013 advisories. ([#41])

### Test infrastructure

- The Technitium test container now runs as the host user instead of root.
  Bind-mounted test data is created with host ownership at the make-target
  layer, eliminating the need for `sudo rm -rf` cleanup after a test run.
  CI runners (GitHub Actions UID 1001) pick up their own UID via
  `HOST_UID` / `HOST_GID` exported from `GNUmakefile`. ([#36])
- In-process TLS fixtures unblock NSS-mode and STIG-strict acceptance
  tests that cannot run under HTTP. The `testacc-up-tls` target generates
  a fresh self-signed CA + server cert under `./testdata/tls/`, brings up
  a Technitium container with HTTPS on port 5443, and runs the full
  acceptance suite over TLS. ([#33])

### Documentation

- DISA STIG library pins refreshed from V3R1 → V3R2 (BIND 9.x) and
  V2R3 → V2R4 (Windows Server 2022 DNS). Both released
  2026-04-01 per the [DISA STIG Public Library](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/).
  Zero validator-code impact: none of the provider's 28 DNS-REQ validators
  cite any of the five rules that changed across both refreshed STIGs.
  Provenance analysis posted as a comment on [#53]. ([#53])
- README expanded with "Why use Terraform with Technitium?" sections for
  already-IaC, new-to-IaC, and multi-Technitium audiences. Quick Start
  split into "Homelab quick start" (HTTP, warn-mode STIG) and "Production
  / hardened deployment" (HTTPS, custom CA, strict mode, full DNSSEC).
  Capability comparison vs. the generic `hashicorp/dns` provider added,
  with an explicit "where `hashicorp/dns` is the better fit" callout for
  AD-integrated / Kerberos environments.
- New community-health files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
  (Contributor Covenant 2.1), GitHub Forms issue templates (bug,
  enhancement), `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` routing security
  reports to the private GitHub Security Advisory flow, and a
  `.github/pull_request_template.md`. ([#60])

### Known limitations

- The three Technitium per-member catalog override flags
  (`overrideCatalogQueryAccess`, `overrideCatalogZoneTransfer`,
  `overrideCatalogNotify`) are not yet exposed. Until they are, settings
  inherited from the catalog zone (queryAccess, zoneTransfer, notify) take
  precedence over any matching settings declared on the member zone via
  `technitium_zone`. The `technitium_catalog_membership` resource emits a
  plan-time warning whenever it is created or updated. Tracked in [#29].
- Catalog-driven zone provisioning to secondary name servers is not exercised
  by the current acceptance suite (single-node test container). Tracked in
  [#30].

### Upgrade Notes

**For strict-mode STIG users upgrading from v1.0.x or v1.1.x:** the
`DNS-REQ-004` and `DNS-REQ-016` STIG validators were silently no-op in
prior releases and now properly enforce. If your existing HCL leaves
`allow_transfer` or `notify` unset on Primary zones, `terraform plan`
will now surface STIG findings under strict mode. Three remediation
paths cover every supported topology:

**DNS-REQ-004 — zone-transfer ACL (NIST AC-3, AC-4):**

```hcl
resource "technitium_zone" "primary_with_secondaries" {
  name = "example.com"
  type = "Primary"

  # Production / hardened: enumerate the secondary nameserver IPs that
  # are authorized to pull zone data via AXFR / IXFR.
  allow_transfer = ["192.0.2.10", "192.0.2.11"]
}

resource "technitium_zone" "primary_no_transfers" {
  name = "internal.example.com"
  type = "Primary"

  # Hidden-primary or single-server topologies: deny transfers entirely.
  # Setting to [] is explicit and satisfies the validator.
  allow_transfer = []
}
```

**DNS-REQ-016 — notify addresses (NIST SC-8, CM-6):**

```hcl
resource "technitium_zone" "primary_with_secondaries" {
  name = "example.com"
  type = "Primary"

  # Production / hardened: list the secondary nameservers that should
  # receive NOTIFY messages when this zone's SOA serial advances.
  notify = ["192.0.2.10", "192.0.2.11"]
}

resource "technitium_zone" "primary_silent" {
  name = "internal.example.com"
  type = "Primary"

  # Hidden-primary topology: suppress NOTIFY entirely. The validator
  # accepts an explicit empty list as a documented intentional choice.
  notify = []
}
```

**If you are not yet ready to populate these fields**, set
`stig_compliance.enforcement = "warn"` in the provider block to demote
the new findings from blocking errors to plan-time warnings while you
work through your zones. `"silent"` suppresses them entirely. Both
settings preserve the validator coverage for future runs.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Breaking Changes

- **Record ID format changed** from `zone/name/type` to `zone::name::type::value`. This affects
  all `technitium_record` resources in state and the `terraform import` format. No state migration
  is provided — re-import any existing records using the new format. ([#18])
- **Import format changed** for all record types:
  - Simple types: `zone::name::type::value`
  - MX: `zone::name::MX::exchange:priority`
  - SRV: `zone::name::SRV::target:priority:weight:port`
  - CAA: `zone::name::CAA::value:flags:tag`

### Added

- Multi-record support: multiple DNS records at the same name and type are now fully managed
  without ID collisions (e.g., round-robin A records, multiple MX records). Set `overwrite = false`
  on each resource. ([#18])
- Type-aware record matching for MX (exchange + priority), SRV (target + priority + weight + port),
  and CAA (value + flags + tag) ensures each record is uniquely identified. ([#18])
- 11 new acceptance tests covering multi-record collision, SRV edge cases, TXT torture tests
  (special characters, long DKIM keys), and lifecycle scenarios (destroy-one-of-two, import
  with siblings). ([#18])
- `.golangci.yml` configuration with 17 linters enabled for security, nil-safety, error handling,
  and code correctness. ([#20])
- `context.Context` propagated through all HTTP client methods, enabling request cancellation
  and timeout propagation from Terraform Plugin Framework. ([#22])
- Scorecard workflow hardening and fuzz tests. ([#11])
- Declarative STIG test suite with schema-aware integration tests. ([#10])

### Fixed

- Record ID collision when multiple records share the same name and type — the original bug
  that caused infinite drift loops and delete failures. ([#6], [#18])
- STIG engine now flags omitted attributes as non-compliant findings instead of silently
  passing (default-allow bug). ([#9], [#10])
- `errcheck` findings: unchecked `resp.Body.Close()` and `f.Close()` return values. ([#19])
- `staticcheck` finding: De Morgan's law applied to NSS categorization check. ([#19])
- `rangeValCopy` in STIG engine: eliminated 128-byte copy per iteration. ([#20])
- `noctx` findings: HTTP calls now use `http.NewRequestWithContext` instead of
  `http.Client.Get`/`PostForm`. ([#22])

### Changed

- Migrated golangci-lint from v1.64.8 to v2.11.4. ([#12], [#19])
- Import state now defaults `overwrite` to `false` (previously `true`). ([#18])
- Record `id` schema attribute no longer uses `UseStateForUnknown` plan modifier since the ID
  changes when the record value changes. ([#18])

### Dependencies

- `actions/checkout` 4.3.1 → 6.0.2 ([#13])
- `actions/setup-go` 5.6.0 → 6.3.0 ([#17])
- `actions/upload-artifact` 6.0.0 → 7.0.0 ([#14])
- `actions/attest-build-provenance` updated ([#16])
- `crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg` 6.3.0 → 7.0.0 ([#15])

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-23
